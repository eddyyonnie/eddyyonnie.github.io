<h2>The best things about my projects</h2>
<p>With time i have been doing a little bit of website building practices and find it rather nice to have to build something on my on under the guidance of <strong>moringaschool</strong> and the support of <strong>my friends</strong> right from scratch.</p>
<p>Here are some of the projects that i've done so far:</p>
<ol id="ol">
  <li><a href="https://github.com/eddyyonnie/my-first-website">my first website</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/eddyyonnie/Hope">my favourite things</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/eddyyonnie/zangu/blob/master/zangu.html">my pet</a></li>
</ol>

<h2>My first project</h2>
<p>This actually contains a few or more things about how well moringa has worked out for me.In its defence and enthusiastic vigilance it was able to work out a few or more things to make me get the concept on codding right.</p>
<h2>My favourite things</h2>
<p>A briff description of what i like and the constituents is provided there in details.</p>
<h2>My pet</h2>
<p>Here, i mentioned my pet  and just some few fun facts about me.Still, i found it fun to share it with you guys.</p>
<h1>About me</h1>
<p>Complicated as i may seem, i'm actually kind of insecure at times.Especially when it comes to large crowds.i'm terrible at that.</p>
<p>I have a few dark secrets hidden within my secretive self and have no problem sharing with those i trust.For example,from scratch:</p>
<ul>
  <li>1999:Year of birth.</li>
  <li>2002-2004:Joined kindergatten and got through with that.</li>
  <li>2004-2012:Did my curriculum under primary education and successfully graduated.</li>
  <li>2013-2014:Stayed out for a while due to reasons that forced me to stay out of the learning field.</li>
  <li>2015-2018:Did my secondary course learning and finished successfully.</li>
  <li>2019-date:Joined moringa school and am happily coding. </li>
</ul>
<h1>Hobbies</h1>
<p>I am so into a number of things and actually find it so awsome.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Ballgames and workouts</li>
  <li>Bunjyjumping</li>
  <li>Dancing</li>
  <li>Singing</li>
  <li>Painting and drawing</li>
  <li>violin playing</li>
</ol>
<p>What stands out from all these is the fact that <strong>i am an addict of car racing and the astonishing race car designs</strong>.</p>
<h1>My reason why...</h1>
<p>The most convenient and from heart reason as to why i am in moringa is because there's nothing i'de rather spend my life doing besides coding ,and moringaschool has proven to give quite a hearty experience.</p>
